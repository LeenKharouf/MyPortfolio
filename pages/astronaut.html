     <h2>Welcome to an Interactive Art Experience!</h2>

    <h2>Using Procreate</h2>
    <p>This illustration was created in Procreate! The key to this 3D effect is the use of layers. Just like stacking sheets, I arranged different elements of the artwork on separate layers.</p>
    <br>


    <h2>Unveiling the Parallax Effect</h2>
    <p>Now comes the most exciting part — the parallax effect. I've arranged the layers to respond to your touch or mouse movements using Javascript. As you navigate the artwork, different layers move at different speeds, giving you a sense of depth and motion.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p> Starting on this artistic journey means a lot to me because I've always had a deep love for art. I've been creating art for years, and it's been a big part of who I am. As a computer engineering student, my focus shifted away from art due to the demands of my studies.

Now, I've found a way to bring together my technical skills and my passion for art. This artwork is the result of that mix—a way for me to reconnect with my creativity: my first experiment with the parallax effect, representing a step into the realm of interactive art.</p>
